How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It's the intermediate stage between working directory and the repository. buffer
The staging area is an intermediate area where I can add changes before
committing them to the repository.  This allows me to add changes to the
staging area one-by-one, then commit them all at once, which makes it easier
to specify what changes should go into each commit.  That makes the commits
more valuable, since the commit history is easier to navigate when I create
one commit per logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I use git add to add the file from working directory to staging area, use git status to check the differece between working directory and staging area, check if the new is ready to commit, then I use git commit to add new file to staging area, this could ensure that one commit per logical change.
